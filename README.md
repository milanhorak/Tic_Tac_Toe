# Tic Tac Toe
I used to play tic tac toe with my friends as a kid. Of course that time with paper and pencil.

After 3 months learning of Python, I made this implementation of Tic Tac Toe for 2 players,
with 9x9 grid and streak of 5 marks to win.

If you run the game for the first time, I recommend you to read the rules, otherwise press Enter to start game.
